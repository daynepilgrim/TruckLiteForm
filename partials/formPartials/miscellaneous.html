                <p class="help-block">* A conviction record will not necessarily be a bar to employment. A conviction which is substantially related
                    to the functions or qualifications of the position(s) for which you are applying may be taken into consideration,
                    pursuant to an individualized assessment and in accordance with applicable law. No candidate is obligated
                    to disclose sealed, annulled or expunged convictions or convictions pardoned by the Governor. Failure
                    to honestly and completely answer this question (other than as described below) will result in discontinued
                    consideration of the applicant or termination of employment. This information will be used for job-related
                    purposes consistent with applicable law and is only relevant in determining whether the conviction is
                    related to the job for which you are applying. Factors such as age at the time of the offense(s), seriousness
                    of the offense(s), nature of the violation(s), its relation, if any, to the job you are seeking and rehabilitation
                    will be taken into account. Do not report any conviction that has been sealed, expunged, statutorily
                    eradicated, annulled, impounded, erased, dismissed under the First Offenderâ€™s law, pardoned by the Governor,
                    or which state law allows you to lawfully deny. Based on current state law, applicants/residents of Pennsylvania
                    are not obligated to report misdemeanor convictions. Applicants/residents of California, Connecticut,
                    Hawaii, Kentucky, Massachusetts, or Washington may not be required to answer this question or may have
                    a right to exclude certain convictions from your response. Applicants are not required to disclose violations,
                    infractions, petty infractions, petty misdemeanors or summary offenses. </p>
